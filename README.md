# 📘 Algorithm Diary

> *Think beyond code. Solve problems. Make impact.*

This repository is my personal algorithm diary — a daily habit of solving problems, learning data structures, and comparing solutions across multiple programming languages.

Whether preparing for system design, coding interviews, or improving problem-solving intuition, this space tracks my journey beyond just writing code.
