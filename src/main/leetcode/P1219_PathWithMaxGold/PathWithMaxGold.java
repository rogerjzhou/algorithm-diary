/**
 * LeetCode 1219 - Path with Maximum Gold
 *
 * Tags: Backtracking, DFS, Matrix
 *
 * Approach:
 *  - Try starting DFS from each cell that contains gold (> 0).
 *  - At each step, collect the current cellâ€™s gold, mark it as visited by setting it to 0.
 *  - Recursively explore all four directions (up, down, left, right) without revisiting any cell.
 *  - After exploring, backtrack by restoring the original gold value.
 *  - Keep track of the maximum gold collected across all paths.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(m * n * 3^(m * n))
 *   - In the worst case, DFS starts from every cell and explores all possible paths.
 *   - Each move has up to 3 valid directions (excluding the direction it came from).
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(m * n)
 *   - Due to the recursion call stack (maximum depth is m * n), and in-place marking avoids extra memory.
