     * LeetCode 207 - Course Schedule
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
     *
     * Approach (DFS with cycle detection):
     * - Model the course prerequisites as a directed graph (adjacency list)
     * - Use a visited array with 3 states:
     *     - 0 = unvisited
     *     - 1 = visiting (currently in the DFS call stack)
     *     - 2 = visited (fully explored and safe)
     * - Perform DFS for each course:
     *     - If a course is currently being visited and we reach it again (visited == 1), a cycle is detected â†’ return false
     *     - If a course has been visited before (visited == 2), skip it
     *     - Otherwise, recursively DFS all of its neighbors
     * - If no cycle is found in any DFS path, return true
     *
     * Time: O(V + E), where V = numCourses and E = total prerequisites
     * Space: O(V + E), for graph storage and visited state array
