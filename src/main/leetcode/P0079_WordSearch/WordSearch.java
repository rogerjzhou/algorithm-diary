/**
 * LeetCode 79 - Word Search
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/
 *
 * Approach (Backtracking + DFS):
 * - Iterate over every cell in the board as a potential starting point.
 * - If the current cell matches word.charAt(0), launch a DFS from that cell.
 * - In dfs(i, j, idx):
 *     1. If idx == word.length(), we have matched all characters; return true.
 *     2. Temporarily mark board[i][j] as visited by setting visited[i][j] = true.
 *     3. For each of the four directions (down, right, up, left):
 *     4. If none of the four directions succeed, backtrack by setting visited[i][j] = false and return false.
 *
 * Time: O(N * 4^L), where N = number of cells (board.length * board[0].length) and L = word.length()
 * Space: O(L), due to recursion depth and visited array (visited is O(N), but only one call stack of depth â‰¤ L)
